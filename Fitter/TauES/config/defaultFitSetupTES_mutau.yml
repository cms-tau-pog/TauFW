# NOTE: In general, the main information (channel, baselineCuts, etc.) should be given.
#       More specific sub-options (like weight replacement for systematic uncertainties) are optional


# Typically, each channel will have its own config file; combination can be done at datacard level
channel: mutau
# Tag can be used to differentiate between scenarios

# These regions will be defined when creating inputs or making plots
# At this point, they do not need to be exclusive; 
# PLEASE NOTE:
#     - which regions are included in the fit will be defined in obervables section --> adjust when changing regions
#     - additional cross section scale factors applied to some processes need to be given in these regions to be considered --> adjust in scaleFactors section
