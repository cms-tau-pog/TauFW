## Config file for default TES fit in mutau channel
## contact: saskia.falke@cern.ch

# NOTE: In general, the main information (channel, baselineCuts, etc.) should be given.
#       More specific sub-options (like weight replacement for systematic uncertainties) are optional
#       These are used for the TES fit and are not needed for plotting only


# Typically, each channel will have its own config file; combination can be done at datacard level
channel: mutau
# Tag can be used to differentiate between scenarios
tag: ""

baselineCuts: "q_1*q_2<0 && iso_1<0.15 && idDecayModeNewDMs_2 && idDeepTau2018v2p1VSjet_2>=32 && idDeepTau2017v2p1VSe_2>=2 && idDeepTau2017v2p1VSmu_2>=8 && !lepton_vetoes_notau && metfilter"

# These regions will be defined when creating inputs or making plots
# At this point, they do not need to be exclusive; 
# PLEASE NOTE:
#     - which regions are included in the fit will be defined in obervables section --> adjust when changing regions
#     - additional cross section scale factors applied to some processes need to be given in these regions to be considered --> adjust in scaleFactors section
