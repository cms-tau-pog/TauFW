# Tips and tricks for presentation

In this last section, we will put some unordered list of tips for the presentation to be shown in a simposium to a jury.

* At first, think together in your group about how to explain the analysis in an understandable way. Tell your audience a story - your presentation should have a clear
path to follow, with an introduction at the beginning, and a summary and conclusion at the end.
* Try to use only a few words in your slides, and create plots, diagrams and sketches to make your points - pictures tell often more than words.
* Please avoid abbreviations and slang, this usually leads to confusion.
* Highlight important words in your slides, in case you have some text on it.
* Each slide shouls have a message, try to put it as a short sentence on it.
* Your presentation should be within your given time-slot - about 15 minutes. On average, everyone of you would need 1 to 2 minutes per slides. Consequently, you should
not use too many slides to explain the analysis.
* Do not loose yourself in details - figure out which points are relevant to explain the analysis. Details can be put always as backup slides after the conclusion.
* Practice the talk, especially if you present as a group. Everyone of you should know which slides to present.
* And most important: Have fun presenting your results and what you have learned! :)
